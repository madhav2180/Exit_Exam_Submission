# The Telecom Retention Challenge: Predicting Customer Churn
You are a data scientist working for a major telecom company facing a critical issue: customer churn. Despite offering a range of services, including phone, internet, and security, customers are leaving at a troubling rate. The company has tasked you with developing a model that can predict which customers are at the highest risk of churning, so that targeted retention efforts can be made to keep them.

Your dataset contains crucial information about each customer: their demographics, the services they use, billing methods, payment history, and, most importantly, whether they have already churned. Your job is to analyze these factors and create a predictive model that can identify customers likely to leave in the future.

The stakes are high. Reducing churn will not only increase company revenue but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. Armed with insights from this dataset, you can help the company understand the reasons behind customer departures and implement strategies to keep them from leaving.
